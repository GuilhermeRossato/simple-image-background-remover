Drop an image and this page will remove the background by a threshold value. Optionally resizing the output.

There are no analytics, no tracking, no ads or anything else, it is as simple as I could make it.

# How does it Work?

It puts a `<input>` html element on the whole page where you can select images, then it loads each image into a canvas (no server code) on your own browser. Currently it does not do anything besides that, but eventually it will remove pixels based on a user-input threshold.

# Can I use it for <insert anything>?

Yes, it is free and [MIT](https://github.com/GuilhermeRossato/simple-image-background-remover/blob/master/LICENSE)-licensed. Just don't cause trouble.
